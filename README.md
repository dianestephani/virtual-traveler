### User Stories:
- As a user, I want to see a clean home page with a search bar.

### Stretch Goals
- Give the user the ability to log in with a username and password.
- Incorporate a Browse page where users can select from randomly generated cities, rather than searching for something specific.
- Give users the ability to leave comments about cities.
